- SongQueue -> collection of Song Models
- SongQueueView -> Bound to SongQueue
  * SQV is a listener for adding, removing and dequeueing the queue.
- SongQueueEntryView -> Snippets that populate the SQV
  * SQEV is a listener for the end of the current song

So, making multiple queues is a matter of correctly building new copies of the above things.

1) Visual representation of selection process
2) Create new playlist by name
   * builds new copies of SQ, SQV, and SQEV
3) Selection event associates 'current queue'
4) Given 'current queue', click events for typical adding add to the specific 'current queue'
   * Memory for which queue has which songs after switching back and forth with proper rendering
